Barraca presenta su 59 Aniversario con Andres Campo y Melanie Ribbe La ya floreciente carrera de Andrés Campo está experimentando un rápido y espectacular ascenso. De convertirse en uno de los DJs y productores más queridos en España, su nombre es ahora sinónimo de talento, calidad y música emocionante, tanto como DJ, incluyendo su residencia en Florida 135 junto con muchos shows internacionales, y como productor, firmando con Drumcode, FilthOnAcid, Second State, Intec, Mood, Odd Recordings y Mindshake sólo en el último año.","With more than 50 years of history behind it, Barraca has been open since the summer of 1965. In the mid-80s its popularity rose due to the great electronic music movement that took place in Spain. The movement is known as ""La Ruta del Bacalao"", where they offered a host of festivals and festivals along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, especially the Valencian one. Barraca took advantage of the movement and positioned itself as one of the greatest exponents of this underground movement. Baracca is divided up into 4 rooms: - Circo: is the largest room, with a capacity for almost a thousand people, the place where the great events of Valencia are held. DJs ranking amongst Richie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier, Ricardo Villalobos and Danny Tenaglia have passed through the booth. No doubt, the best. - La Barraca: the original club underwent an impressive renovation in 2007 that has allowed it to continue offering the best electronic music in Valencia. - Showroom: this is your alternative room, where the young and rising names of techno and house host more experimental sessions. Dedicated to house music since its beginnings, its original name was simply, House Room. - Terraza: with a capacity of 600 people, it’s a venue to rival some of the best in Ibiza. During the summer, it’s always the first to open. It has a huge fan base and the coolest sounds of Valencia. Barraca has established itself as one of the most important underground clubs in Spain and hosts a lot of great sets by the most anticipated artists. With exactly 12,738 sessions and more than 21,400 DJs that have passed through the Valencian club, we can say that Barraca is not just a lot of good electronic music. Barraca is synonymous with quality. Barraca delivers the best techno and the best house in all its aspects. DJs and producers like Ricardo Villalobos, Loco Dice, Tania Vulcano, Marco Carola, Ellen Allien and Óscar Mulero are a clear example of this. The dress code is casual, informal, underground. With Xceed you can buy your early bird ticket for Barraca. Alternatively, you can buy it at the door on the night. Barraca is open at the weekends and the night before some holidays. Barraca opens its doors at 00:00 until 06:00 in the morning.

Sound Factory - 24 Aniversario,"Local, Electronica / Downtempo",TBA,Sound Factory,2024-12-14 17:00:00,2024-12-15 07:30:00,More info soon.,"Sound Factory nació en marzo del año 2000 cuando la sala que ocupaba el local donde estaba situada, por aquel entonces Rockola Pinedo, fue trasladada a otra ubicación, en este momento la sala de pinedo adquirió un nuevo nombre y pasó a llamarse «Factory Of Sound» algo más de 3 semanas, para que en Abril del año 2000 pasase a llamarse tal y como la conocimos, «Sound Factory». Siempre bajo la dirección de su maestro de ceremonias, Pedro Contreras, la sala permaneció abierta hasta el mes de Junio del año 2004, cuando cerró sus puertas definitivamente. De la sala tal y como se conoció, queda ya bien poco y es que al cierre de Sound Factory, esta fue abierta en varias ocasiones con distintos nombres y tipos de música, fue sala «Space Valencia» en el año 2008 hasta que en 2009 adquirió el nombre por el que actualmente la conocemos, «Spook Club Vlc». Por su cabina han pasado multitud de deejays pero los que hacen que el espíritu Factory se sienta allá donde van, son son Alfredo Pareja y David Cabeza, posteriormente se incorporaron al team djs Vicente Belenguer y German Bass. Si bien la discoteca cerró en 2004, desde entonces se vienen celebrando cada año 3 fiestas en honor a esta sala, Fallas, Summer Party y el Aniversario.","Segundo tramo, Primer Tramo, Tercer tramo, Primer Tramo - Zona Backstage","15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0","39.4105911,-0.3351692","Carrera del Riu, 399, Valencia, Spain",25.0,https://images.xceed.me/events/banners/sound-factory-summer-festival-4-valencia-xceed-3351.png?w=600&fm=auto,2024-12-04,https://xceed.me/en/valencia/event/sound-factory-24-aniversario--169951,recXFjqFHJ28g9oOp,recXFjqFHJ28g9oOp,Valencia,Saturday,False,39.4105911,-0.3351692,Pobles del Sud

La3 is not only one of the best party clubs in Valencia but it is a meeting point for true music lovers. In terms of music, La3 is now adding more urban styles such as trap, R&B and hip-hop and the popular Friday night is adapting to the needs of its public, the young and cosmopolitan masses. To satisfy you on Saturday nights, there is a new event at the club called “Electric Saturdays”, where you can enjoy the best national and international techno and house DJs in any of the 3 rooms that the venue boasts.

Their separate career have been very different, which makes them complement each other perfectly, which makes their sessions characterized by a very forceful character. They have a great dancefloor reading and do not hesitate to play with various styles close to minimal house. They are combined generating sensations on the track, counteracting ups and downs, breaks and melodies. Together they have played, besides many places in Ibiza, like Eden, Playa Soleil, Cova Santa or Octan, in places like Les Enfants, Jazzy (Madrid), Friedas Buexe (Switzerland), Fabric London, Marrakech with Supervibe and many more. In the studio, these disparate trajectories until they come together generate something special, just like in the booth. They understand music and the way of producing in very different ways, which means that when they come together and create a common workflow, they achieve great results, having a very characteristic sound, which can be seen in the different musical styles that they are capable of doing.

Now, it’s located in what is known as “Little Ibiza”, the closest zone to Port Olímpic. Pacha Barcelona got two indoor rooms (the main room and the Red Room) and a spectacular terrace with amazing sea views. There is where Pacha becomes a restaurant during the day, where you can enjoy the best Mediterranean cuisine and drink some cocktails while listening to the best deep house and chill out music. Basically, it’s like you were in a Beach Club in Ibiza. Honouring its name, Pacha Barcelona has become one of the best (if not the best club) in Barcelona. And, honouring the logo of the two cherries, it offers sweet, juicy and truly tempting experiences. Regarding the music, we're talking about a versatile club, now with its ""Crazy Mondays"" parties on Mondays, ""Mad Tuesdays"" on Tuesdays, “VICE” on Wednesdays, ""La Juerga"" on Thursdays, ""Moulaga"" on Fridays, ""Pegao"" on Saturdays and ""SIGHT"" on Sundays. Ranging from hits, reggaeton or hip-hop to the best house, deep house and techno in town, Pacha Barcelona attracts the best DJs in the world. The club has recently hosted C. Tangana, Bob Sinclar, Robbie Rivera, Claptone and, in nights hosted by Sight, underground electronic DJs like Sven Väth, Luciano or Davide Squillace. Pacha Barcelona isn’t just a club, it represents everything Pacha represents around the world: wherever you are, Pacha always offers the best parties and artists a city can offer. The place is very attractive, due to its casual and elegant atmosphere. This club is the big pearl among the nightclubs located at Barcelona’s Port Olímpic. It’s open 7 days a week and the most appropriate clothing is smart-casual, although for the SIGHT party on Sundays the access policy varies, giving a wider freedom of styles and letting the music be the protagonist.

HEAVY HOUSE SOCIETY by SIDNEY CHARLES,"Underground, House","Sidney Charles, Locklead, Luca Donzelli, Andrew Azara",INPUT High Fidelity Dance Club,2024-11-23 23:59:00,2024-11-24 06:00:00,"Sidney Charles has mastered the art of high impact house music that comes with a signature sense of depth, melody and groove. That unique style has made the Hamburg-born DJ, producer and label boss one of the underground's most prominent names: last year was his busiest ever with multiple chart-topping releases, high profile support from Radio 1 and standout gigs across the world. In 2024, the proven tastemaker will focus on his already influential Heavy House Society label with a series of HHS events taking place in locations worldwide. The last year has seen Sidney make an indelible mark on the scene. He played in Ibiza at the likes of Amnesia, DC10 and Cova Santa. He played to large crowds across several South American countries and all over the US from Miami to Las Vegas to New York and LA. He played in key Spanish cities at Input, Fabrik Madrid, Weekend Beach Festival, frequently visited Italy, played in the Netherlands multiple times a month and cemented his close relationship at UK hotbeds like Manchester's Warehouse Project and Leeds' Mint Warehouse. Whether playing to a close and compact crowd in a small basement or tearing up a vast festival main stage, Sidney knows how to join the dots between the past and the present. He manages to open up new house worlds with his educated selections but never forgets to blow up the dance floor in the process. Just like his productions, his DJ sets are full of surprises, twists and turns but also rooted in physical grooves. His love of jazz, hip hop and funk and his vast knowledge of the 90s sounds always shine through with plenty of heavy bass which makes the Sidney Sound so irresistible. Years after his first breakout hit, Sidney continues to reach the top of the charts with his newest creations. In 2023 there were two separate hits on different labels in Beatport's genre charts. Namely ‘Keep Rocking’ on Heavy House Society, and one of the biggest underground records of the year ‘House 2 Heal’ on Moxy Muzik, while he also released on the likes of Cécille, MicroHertz & PIV. Sidney's Heavy House Society is already a respected go-to outlet for solid and innovative house music. It mixes up releases from top-tier artists and well curated new school talents such as Kolter (aka Djoko), Ozzie Guven, Luuk Van Dijk, Locklead, Madvilla, M-High and many more. Sidney will be heading up the global Heavy House Society events with guest DJ’s curated from the label roster. He has solo releases in the works for the label as well as Solid Grooves, You&Me; and has a collaboration EP dropping with Kolter. All this is proof that Sidney Charles is at the top of his game.

From the very beginning, their parties were in everybody’s chats, both young and not so young people from the upper area in town. Located in the middle of Carrer Tuset, the club always knew what it wanted to be: a meeting point for forever friends, for those who want to have fun with their lifelong friends in a familiar club, cosy and true to a musical style always liked by the biggest audiences. Sutton Barcelona breathes a youthful, but mature atmosphere. Minimum age of 21 years old is required, although the public is usually around 23 or 25, even reaching 40 depending on the party. It's not weird to see public figures of high relevance in Sutton, such as actors, elite athletes or football players, fashion designers or politicians. Sutton Barcelona is one of the most exclusive clubs in the city and VIP people know it. You only need to take a look at some of the pictures of their Facebook albums or attend some of their big parties, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve, to discover their high-end style. Sutton Barcelona gives a remarkable prominence to music. The position of the DJ booth enhances the DJ to the audience and makes it a central figure of the event, although many times the sound is borne by resident artists. Commercial electronic music (mainly electro-house, dance and big room) sets the pace, although the R'n'B and the hits have their glorious moments as well. Despite this, Sutton has lived historic nights with huge names such as David Guetta, Galantis, The Martinez Brothers, Gianluca Vacchi or even Bruno Mars. You always have to keep an eye on their agenda and line-up before jumping into their booking options. Sutton always warns that you will be a victim of their pics. We don't know if that's the reason, but the required dress code is elegant, smart-casual. You don't need to wear a smart jacket or a long dress, although if you do, you won't be an exception. A well-fitting shirt, a good set and good shoes are enough (but essential) if you don't want, both boys and girls, be rejected. There's always quite a big line in the door of Sutton Barcelona.

From the very beginning, their parties were in everybody’s chats, both young and not so young people from the upper area in town. Located in the middle of Carrer Tuset, the club always knew what it wanted to be: a meeting point for forever friends, for those who want to have fun with their lifelong friends in a familiar club, cosy and true to a musical style always liked by the biggest audiences. Sutton Barcelona breathes a youthful, but mature atmosphere. Minimum age of 21 years old is required, although the public is usually around 23 or 25, even reaching 40 depending on the party. It's not weird to see public figures of high relevance in Sutton, such as actors, elite athletes or football players, fashion designers or politicians. Sutton Barcelona is one of the most exclusive clubs in the city and VIP people know it. You only need to take a look at some of the pictures of their Facebook albums or attend some of their big parties, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve, to discover their high-end style. Sutton Barcelona gives a remarkable prominence to music. The position of the DJ booth enhances the DJ to the audience and makes it a central figure of the event, although many times the sound is borne by resident artists. Commercial electronic music (mainly electro-house, dance and big room) sets the pace, although the R'n'B and the hits have their glorious moments as well. Despite this, Sutton has lived historic nights with huge names such as David Guetta, Galantis, The Martinez Brothers, Gianluca Vacchi or even Bruno Mars. You always have to keep an eye on their agenda and line-up before jumping into their booking options. Sutton always warns that you will be a victim of their pics. We don't know if that's the reason, but the required dress code is elegant, smart-casual. You don't need to wear a smart jacket or a long dress, although if you do, you won't be an exception. A well-fitting shirt, a good set and good shoes are enough (but essential) if you don't want, both boys and girls, be rejected. There's always quite a big line in the door of Sutton Barcelona. Almost every day it opens. And the ticket always costs 15 or 20€. That's why we are here. With the Xceed app, you can always sign up to the guest list before going to the club to get in for free. If you love to start the weekend quite soon, you are lucky, because Sutton is your party venue. Sutton opens from Wednesday to Saturday. With no exception. In addition to all the holidays eves, of course. Its schedule is the usual one in nightclubs: it opens at midnight and closes at 6 am, closing maybe at 5:30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays, depending on the number of people partying inside.",Guest List,0.0,"41.395959,2.151659","Tuset, 13, Barcelona, Spain",0.0,https://images.xceed.me/events/banners/a-la-mode-48-barcelona-xceed-efdb.png?w=600&fm=auto,18/11/2024,https://xceed.me/en/barcelona/event/a-la-mode-85--167651,recFdI10gEr26oqmq,recFdI10gEr26oqmq,Barcelona,Friday,True,41.395959,2.151659,Sarrià - Sant Gervasi

If we followed Bas Ibellini around the world over the past few years, our memories might be stained with sweaty heaving crowds, beaches in Ibiza, dancefloors in New York, after-parties in London, and festivals in Mexico. In recent years, he has had the opportunity to perform at venerable night clubs including Fabric, DC10, Fuse Brussels and Output New York; alongside invitations to appear at key festivals including Sunwaves Romania and BPM in Mexico. A deep-rooted love for music, passed down from a musical family, has placed Bas in a fortunate position. Years of hard work, from pushing himself to become an expert turntablist as a youngster to putting on his own ‘Peculiar’ parties in East London, have laid the foundations for his growing success. When Bas isn't touring or in the studio, organising the perfect party for friends and booking world class acts is his passion. Previous guests have been Seth Troxler, The Martinez Brothers, Guy Gerber, The Mole, Herodot to name a few. On the production tip, Bas has taken a considered though enthusiastic tact, spending days on end toiling away in the studio. Learning the craft inside out, he prefers to take his time to release music. Over the last three years he has released on Seth Troxler and The Martinez Brothers’ Tuskegee imprint, and Damian Lazarus' Crosstown Rebels label.","In the heart of Barcelona, Les Enfants Brillants arises as a club that stands out for its intimate atmosphere and sound quality accompanied by a hi-fi experience designed for the passionate.

Intercambio de un grado de matemáticas por un par de platos, Shonky admite que al principio no tenía idea de qué hacer con ellos. Un clubber dedicado desde su adolescencia, su primera acercamiento real a la escena underground como DJ se produjo en los afterhours Batofar de París. Fue allí donde descubrió su pasión por los sonidos house de San Francisco de los años 90, que en ese entonces pinchaba el residente Dan Ghenacia, y fue ese el comienzo de una amistad duradera, junto con su compañero parisino Dyed Soundorom. Ghenacia reconoció el don de Shonky para la producción desde el principio, “él es un talento natural, sé que cuando él hace algo, va a ser perfecto”, como sus primeros EP en Freak n’Chic Olympia, o su remezcla del track All I Can Say de Danton Eeprom. En 2008 lanzó su álbum debut Time Zone, mientras que los temas ‘Coco Feel & Love Shonk’ y ‘Roudor & Capulet’ marcaron un cruce de caminos musicales en su paso hacia un sonido nuevo – que reveló un house de dimensiones totalmente groovy infundido con voces hipnóticas. Así, pasaron años muy productivos con EPs para Crosstown Rebels, Contexterrior, Culprit y Real Tone. Después de haber pinchado en todo el mundo en clubes como Rex Club París, Space Ibiza, ARMA17 Moscow, Louche Leeds y Club Der Visionaere de Berlin, además de ser un invitado habitual en uno de sus clubes favoritos Panorama Bar, ahora es parte del recién formado proyecto Apollonia. Un sello concebido junto a Dan Ghenacia y Dyed Soundorom, el trío pincha vinilos back- to-back-to-back, generando exquisitos sets de cinco horas o más y presentándose en escenarios como DC10 Ibiza, Fabric London, Movement Torino y BPM Festival Mexico 2013, por nombrar sólo algunos. Como sello, Apollonia se encuentra en la su sexta entrega en los que Shonky ha participado con un EP en solo, The Minneapolis Touch, con el éxito de verano 2012 Close To The Edge, junto a Dan y en Trinidad, el primer EP del trío lanzado en julio de 2013.","In the heart of Barcelona, Les Enfants Brillants arises as a club that stands out for its intimate atmosphere and sound quality accompanied by a hi-fi experience designed for the passionate.

Les Enfants Brillants pres. Ron Bacardi a.k.a Ben Sims,"Underground, International, Electro, House, Deep House","Ben Sims, Tunik",Les Enfants Brillants,2024-12-05 23:59:00,2024-12-06 06:00:00,"Ben Sims is one of techno’s most exciting talents - a DJ who has stayed true to the genre’s funk, groove and electronic fused origins whilst continuing to embrace and nurture its development over the past 25 odd years. Schooled on a diet of Hip Hop, Reggae, Soul, House and Rave in the 80’s, he played a huge part in defining British dance music in the 90s and continues to be an ardent champion of new music, producers and DJs via his many nights, record labels, radio shows, podcasts and relentless touring endeavors. As a DJ, Sims commands your attention, both visually and musically with anything from 3 to 5 decks running near constantly and hands, faders, effects and EQs a blur as tunes overlap to create a dense and quickly evolving collage of sound. Whether playing to 50, 500, or 5000 this unbridled energy and commitment to the art of mixing never falters and shows why Sims is regarded as one of the true masters on the circuit, both a DJ’s DJ and a straight-up party rocker in equal measures. In the studio, Sims has notched up over 50 original productions as well as countless remixes and edits in the past two decades. Embraced by techno’s originators and Detroit ambassadors he’s been, uniquely for a UK artist, called upon by Jeff Mills, Robert Hood and Kevin Saunderson for remixes as well as contributing to the majority of influential European labels from Mote Evolver to Drumcode to Cosmic to Token via Tresor, CLR, and his own (now completed) Theory imprint. Most recently, his disco/house leanings have birthed Ron Bacardi, an alias that has quickly established itself and resulted in 12”s dropping on Bass Culture, Karlovak, Way Back Wednesday and Hardgroove. Outside of the studio and club, the dedication, enthusiasm and search for the next great record/ talent continues. His monthly Run it Red radio show on NTS Live is devoted to new music, his club night, Machine (co-founded with Kirk Degiorgio), was set up to only showcase new music and his label activities, currently taking in Symbolism and Hardgroove, continue to provide rock solid platforms for new producers whilst also showcasing his own studio experiments. Never resting on his laurels, Sims continues to challenge himself at every turn. From a succession of dynamic b2b sets with other highly respected Techno DJs like DVS1, James Ruskin, ROD or Truncate, through his small-room b2b club night Kabuki, countless label/release projects, or a devotion to actively seeking out interesting club nights to play alongside the tried and tested, there’s always something fresh to get excited about with Ben Sims and you can trust that when the current boom (and its converts) move on, he’ll still be here, doing his thing and pushing his vision of techno.","In the heart of Barcelona, Les Enfants Brillants arises as a club that stands out for its intimate atmosphere and sound quality accompanied by a hi-fi experience designed for the passionate.

Through a career spanning three decades, D’Julz has practically done it all. He began spinning in Paris, often playing his home city’s much-talked about early 90’s raves and legendary clubs, all before moving to New–York in 1993 to further hone his skills and cement his reputation as a true taste-maker in his field. The rest, as they say, is history. Despite finding himself in high demand in every corner of the globe, from the States to Japan and countless countries in between, D’Julz has always remained true to his roots in Paris, where he has been running the now legendary “Bass Culture” night at Rex club since 1997. In tandem with the birth of his party D’Julz has dedicated a large amount of time and energy into the production side of his musical output. Solo-wise his music has been signed to some of the world’s finest underground labels – Circus Company, Robsoul, Ovum, Rekids, 20:20 Vision and more. Since D’Julz started producing he has been responsible for a long list of tracks and remixes that have become essential weapons in the record boxes of the world’s DJ elite. As a DJ he exudes class and panache. A gifted curator of music whose pedigree has earned him a loyal international following and a constant tour schedule which sees him travel the worlds major cities every week playing the best venues they have on offer. Not to mention the infamous Circoloco (DC10) where he has held a long-standing residency, taking charge of the main room and the world-renowned red terrace room several times each summer season. Each set demonstrating D’Julz’s uncanny ability to weave his penchant for dub elements into the house and techno sphere and rocking DC10 with potent groove and sultry rhythms. D’Julz remains as enthusiastic as he was when he first started DJing, as his Bass Culture label goes from strength to strength, clocking over 50 releases and he continues to traverse the globe rocking dance floors every weekend.

It's not weird to see public figures of high relevance in Sutton, such as actors, elite athletes or football players, fashion designers or politicians. Sutton Barcelona is one of the most exclusive clubs in the city and VIP people know it. You only need to take a look at some of the pictures of their Facebook albums or attend some of their big parties, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve, to discover their high-end style. Sutton Barcelona gives a remarkable prominence to music. The position of the DJ booth enhances the DJ to the audience and makes it a central figure of the event, although many times the sound is borne by resident artists. Commercial electronic music (mainly electro-house, dance and big room) sets the pace, although the R'n'B and the hits have their glorious moments as well. Despite this, Sutton has lived historic nights with huge names such as David Guetta, Galantis, The Martinez Brothers, Gianluca Vacchi or even Bruno Mars. You always have to keep an eye on their agenda and line-up before jumping into their booking options. Sutton always warns that you will be a victim of their pics. We don't know if that's the reason, but the required dress code is elegant, smart-casual. You don't need to wear a smart jacket or a long dress, although if you do, you won't be an exception. A well-fitting shirt, a good set and good shoes are enough (but essential) if you don't want, both boys and girls, be rejected. There's always quite a big line in the door of Sutton Barcelona. Almost every day it opens. And the ticket always costs 15 or 20€. That's why we are here. With the Xceed app, you can always sign up to the guest list before going to the club to get in for free. If you love to start the weekend quite soon, you are lucky, because Sutton is your party venue. Sutton opens from Wednesday to Saturday. With no exception. In addition to all the holidays eves, of course. Its schedule is the usual one in nightclubs: it opens at midnight and closes at 6 am, closing maybe at 5:30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays, depending on the number of people partying inside.",Guest List,0.0,"41.395959,2.151659","Tuset, 13, Barcelona, Spain",0.0,https://images.xceed.me/events/banners/this-is-sutton-57-barcelona-xceed-f6e9.png?w=600&fm=auto,18/11/2024,https://xceed.me/en/barcelona/event/this-is-sutton-96--167661,recvoXBwdUMQVO47U,recvoXBwdUMQVO47U,Barcelona,Saturday,True,41.395959,2.151659,Sarrià - Sant Gervasi

From the very beginning, their parties were in everybody’s chats, both young and not so young people from the upper area in town. Located in the middle of Carrer Tuset, the club always knew what it wanted to be: a meeting point for forever friends, for those who want to have fun with their lifelong friends in a familiar club, cosy and true to a musical style always liked by the biggest audiences. Sutton Barcelona breathes a youthful, but mature atmosphere. Minimum age of 21 years old is required, although the public is usually around 23 or 25, even reaching 40 depending on the party. It's not weird to see public figures of high relevance in Sutton, such as actors, elite athletes or football players, fashion designers or politicians. Sutton Barcelona is one of the most exclusive clubs in the city and VIP people know it. You only need to take a look at some of the pictures of their Facebook albums or attend some of their big parties, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve, to discover their high-end style. Sutton Barcelona gives a remarkable prominence to music. The position of the DJ booth enhances the DJ to the audience and makes it a central figure of the event, although many times the sound is borne by resident artists. Commercial electronic music (mainly electro-house, dance and big room) sets the pace, although the R'n'B and the hits have their glorious moments as well. Despite this, Sutton has lived historic nights with huge names such as David Guetta, Galantis, The Martinez Brothers, Gianluca Vacchi or even Bruno Mars. You always have to keep an eye on their agenda and line-up before jumping into their booking options. Sutton always warns that you will be a victim of their pics. We don't know if that's the reason, but the required dress code is elegant, smart-casual. You don't need to wear a smart jacket or a long dress, although if you do, you won't be an exception. A well-fitting shirt, a good set and good shoes are enough (but essential) if you don't want, both boys and girls, be rejected. There's always quite a big line in the door of Sutton Barcelona. Almost every day it opens. And the ticket always costs 15 or 20€. That's why we are here. With the Xceed app, you can always sign up to the guest list before going to the club to get in for free. If you love to start the weekend quite soon, you are lucky, because Sutton is your party venue. Sutton opens from Wednesday to Saturday. With no exception. In addition to all the holidays eves, of course. Its schedule is the usual one in nightclubs: it opens at midnight and closes at 6 am, closing maybe at 5:30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays, depending on the number of people partying inside.","Bottle Service, FINAL RELEASE ENTRADA ANTICIPADA, Lista Gratis de 18:00 a 18:30, Early Bird - Entrada Anticipada","0.0, 12.0, 15.0, 200.0","41.395959,2.151659","Tuset, 13, Barcelona, Spain","0.0, 12.0, 15.0, 200.0",https://images.xceed.me/events/banners/el-tardet-x-sutton-9-barcelona-xceed-6ec1.png?w=600&fm=auto,18/11/2024,https://xceed.me/en/barcelona/event/el-tardet-x-sutton-20--170527,recWTly7Op3bJOckE,recWTly7Op3bJOckE,Barcelona,Saturday,True,41.395959,2.151659,Sarrià - Sant Gervasi

Dr.B’s roots are in UKG, growing a globally-recognised label slinging out toasty cuts from new producers and re-issues from the golden era, but this is just a slither of the London-born DJ’s eclectic collection. You only need to flick through his recent bumper to bumpers to see how far and wide he can go. Whether it’s meaty chunks of electro, techno, and minimal with Evan Baggs, cross-genre party starters alongside Bradley Zero, straight shellers with Interplanetary Criminal, or just throwing it down alone, he’ll bring a bag of belters whatever the weather, wherever the crowd. After establishing himself as one of the UK’s most in-demand selectors, the London-born DJ has taken operations worldwide. From the floating intimacy of Berlin’s Hoppetosse to the sheer scale of Glastonbury, Fabric’s brutal brickwork to the iconic caverns of Kiev’s Art Club Closer and Mkvtvarse in Georgia – local, national, and global venues are the workshops for Dr. B’s versatile trotters. If he’s not getting his stirling’s worth out of a treasured travel pillow, playing venues and festivals across the UK and beyond, you’ll find him shooting three-pointers, digging into next week, or kickin’ it in front of the box with a moderately-priced pho.","In the heart of Barcelona, Les Enfants Brillants arises as a club that stands out for its intimate atmosphere and sound quality accompanied by a hi-fi experience designed for the passionate.

Their goal is to do something different and creative they can be proud of. The name 753 comes from an 11th century samurai code of honor that inspired an entire nation to fight for its ideals.

The 753 duo produces hard techno. They intend to innovate that scene and show what they are capable of. The people who discover them really appreciate their work and style, and as a result they have been able to work with record labels such as Gomboc, Hard Vision, Definition Of Hard techno, Märked, SCTR.","In the heart of Poble Espanyol lies INPUT High Fidelity Dance Club, the techno temple in Barcelona.

From the very beginning, their parties were in everybody’s chats, both young and not so young people from the upper area in town. Located in the middle of Carrer Tuset, the club always knew what it wanted to be: a meeting point for forever friends, for those who want to have fun with their lifelong friends in a familiar club, cosy and true to a musical style always liked by the biggest audiences. Sutton Barcelona breathes a youthful, but mature atmosphere. Minimum age of 21 years old is required, although the public is usually around 23 or 25, even reaching 40 depending on the party. It's not weird to see public figures of high relevance in Sutton, such as actors, elite athletes or football players, fashion designers or politicians. Sutton Barcelona is one of the most exclusive clubs in the city and VIP people know it. You only need to take a look at some of the pictures of their Facebook albums or attend some of their big parties, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve, to discover their high-end style. Sutton Barcelona gives a remarkable prominence to music. The position of the DJ booth enhances the DJ to the audience and makes it a central figure of the event, although many times the sound is borne by resident artists. Commercial electronic music (mainly electro-house, dance and big room) sets the pace, although the R'n'B and the hits have their glorious moments as well. Despite this, Sutton has lived historic nights with huge names such as David Guetta, Galantis, The Martinez Brothers, Gianluca Vacchi or even Bruno Mars. You always have to keep an eye on their agenda and line-up before jumping into their booking options. Sutton always warns that you will be a victim of their pics. We don't know if that's the reason, but the required dress code is elegant, smart-casual. You don't need to wear a smart jacket or a long dress, although if you do, you won't be an exception. A well-fitting shirt, a good set and good shoes are enough (but essential) if you don't want, both boys and girls, be rejected. There's always quite a big line in the door of Sutton Barcelona. Almost every day it opens. And the ticket always costs 15 or 20€. That's why we are here. With the Xceed app, you can always sign up to the guest list before going to the club to get in for free.

From the very beginning, their parties were in everybody’s chats, both young and not so young people from the upper area in town. Located in the middle of Carrer Tuset, the club always knew what it wanted to be: a meeting point for forever friends, for those who want to have fun with their lifelong friends in a familiar club, cosy and true to a musical style always liked by the biggest audiences. Sutton Barcelona breathes a youthful, but mature atmosphere. Minimum age of 21 years old is required, although the public is usually around 23 or 25, even reaching 40 depending on the party. It's not weird to see public figures of high relevance in Sutton, such as actors, elite athletes or football players, fashion designers or politicians. Sutton Barcelona is one of the most exclusive clubs in the city and VIP people know it. You only need to take a look at some of the pictures of their Facebook albums or attend some of their big parties, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve, to discover their high-end style. Sutton Barcelona gives a remarkable prominence to music. The position of the DJ booth enhances the DJ to the audience and makes it a central figure of the event, although many times the sound is borne by resident artists. Commercial electronic music (mainly electro-house, dance and big room) sets the pace, although the R'n'B and the hits have their glorious moments as well. Despite this, Sutton has lived historic nights with huge names such as David Guetta, Galantis, The Martinez Brothers, Gianluca Vacchi or even Bruno Mars. You always have to keep an eye on their agenda and line-up before jumping into their booking options. Sutton always warns that you will be a victim of their pics. We don't know if that's the reason, but the required dress code is elegant, smart-casual. You don't need to wear a smart jacket or a long dress, although if you do, you won't be an exception. A well-fitting shirt, a good set and good shoes are enough (but essential) if you don't want, both boys and girls, be rejected. There's always quite a big line in the door of Sutton Barcelona. Almost every day it opens. And the ticket always costs 15 or 20€. That's why we are here. With the Xceed app, you can always sign up to the guest list before going to the club to get in for free. If you love to start the weekend quite soon, you are lucky, because Sutton is your party venue. Sutton opens from Wednesday to Saturday. With no exception.

In a short time, she became a curator of KISS FM stage and a resident at the legendary Kazantip festival, she also hosted her weekly live radio show from 2006 to 2016 on the aforementioned radio station. In 2010, she was offered residency at Moscow’s cult Arma17 club. Inspired by the club’s team and their project, Nastia began to organize her own parties in Ukraine. After gaining experience and recognition, Nastia, together with the team of Closer, the famous club in Kyiv, created the Strichka festival in 2014, which runs to this day. Whilst getting serious about techno music, Nastia created a new label – NECHTO. The name itself is an anagram of “ techno” and translates as “something else” from origin. During the pandemic, Nastia kept herself busy and became the first resident of the Beatport Residency project, where she presented the majority of Ukrainian producers and DJs, and released two seasons of her self-authored projects on YouTube. One of them is True Talk, where she interviewed Ukrainian colleagues, and the second is an audio-visual project Scary Beautiful, where Nastia played selected demo tracks sent by both young upcoming producers and well-known respected musicians. The sets were recorded in unique locations. After the project aired, Nastia released the music that she played on her label. In addition to house and techno, Nastia is a true fan of jungle and drum and bass music and has included these genres in her performances since 2007. She performed at dnb festivals such as SunAndBass, Hospitality and at the dnb stage “Booha” of the Romanian festival Electric Castle. In 2020, she interviewed Goldie for the print version of the British MixMag, and performed in this genre twice at MixMag Lab. All these years, Nastia’s activities were aimed at popularizing Ukrainian culture and local artists, which made her the face of the Ukrainian electronic music scene on the global stage. Nastia is a rare example of how great success can be achieved solely by DJing, ideas and hard work – so far she is the most touring and popular DJ in the history of Ukraine. She performs at key venues around the world and takes an active social and political positio. In 2022, due to the war in Ukraine, she temporarily moved to Amsterdam and actively supported Ukraine using all of her social instruments, and also opened her own fund to help Ukraine. Currently, she continues to actively perform and represent Ukraine at various dance, media and official platforms.","In the heart of Barcelona, Les Enfants Brillants arises as a club that stands out for its intimate atmosphere and sound quality accompanied by a hi-fi experience designed for the passionate.

Haciendo honor a la calle en la que se encuentra ubicado el club, a escasos pasos de la parada de metro de Velázquez, encontramos Goya Social Club. Su aforo es limitado, no cuenta con una grandísima superficie ni espacio, pero no les hace falta. La idea de club que desde ya hace años manejan los chicos del Goya, es la de la intimidad y calidad. Siempre respaldadas por un exhaustivo trabajo por promover el talento local con algunas pinceladas internacionales. Un gran concepto que les ha hecho merecedores de un público afín y entregado a su oferta músical. Y es que bailar nos gusta, nos gusta mucho. La logística de los espacios del club es inmaculada, unos acabados interiores inspirados en los mejores clubs europeos donde manda el espacio central destinado a mover las caderas. Alrededor de él se articulan algunas mesas y sofás para los Vips. Pero ciñamonos a lo importante, tenemos grandes talentos y artistas, solo nos falta hablar de la difusión. Y de qué manera, Goya demuestra estar a la vanguardia de la tecnología con su sistema de sonido, Funktion One. Podemos asegurarte que si te dejas hipnotizar por los beats procedentes de sus torres y altavoces, nada volverá a parecerte lo mismo. En cuanto a la música, aquellos que se fijen únicamente en las grandes caras y figuras de la industria no verán más allá. Sin embargo, es algo que no suele importar a aquellos que aprecian realmente la indústria de la música dance. Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry. Si hablamos del dress code, nada está escrito, sin reglas, sin normas. Viste como quieras, como más a gusto de te sientas, como más cómodo bailes. ¿Qué más dará camisa o camiseta?

Normalmente podrás comprar entrada en taquilla, pero ten cuidado, el aforo es limitado y no queremos que te quedes en la puerta.

Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta. Sé atrevido, extravagante, cómico o convencional. Tu mismo ayudas a construir la experiencia que todos los asistentes van a vivir.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta. Sé atrevido, extravagante, cómico o convencional. Tu mismo ayudas a construir la experiencia que todos los asistentes van a vivir.

His first big project was Motorbass, a duo with future Cassius member Philippe Zdar that released a string of smoothly uptempo, funky records in the early '90s. He then went solo, hitting big with the Super Discount album in 1996. After that, he split his time releasing his own records (like 2000's disco house-inspired Tempovision and two more volumes of the Super Discount series, one in 2004 and one in 2015) and remixing artists like Air, Chromeo, and Kraftwerk. We cannot wait to have him back in our booth for what we know will be one of the best nights of the season! *Please remember to bring ID to ensure smooth entrance at the door.","En pleno corazón de la capital española, encontramos el lugar de peregrinaje de los amantes de la música de baile de calidad. Aquella que realmente nos apasiona y nos hace mover los tobillos hasta bien entrada la madrugada. Haciendo honor a la calle en la que se encuentra ubicado el club, a escasos pasos de la parada de metro de Velázquez, encontramos Goya Social Club. Su aforo es limitado, no cuenta con una grandísima superficie ni espacio, pero no les hace falta. La idea de club que desde ya hace años manejan los chicos del Goya, es la de la intimidad y calidad. Siempre respaldadas por un exhaustivo trabajo por promover el talento local con algunas pinceladas internacionales. Un gran concepto que les ha hecho merecedores de un público afín y entregado a su oferta músical. Y es que bailar nos gusta, nos gusta mucho. La logística de los espacios del club es inmaculada, unos acabados interiores inspirados en los mejores clubs europeos donde manda el espacio central destinado a mover las caderas. Alrededor de él se articulan algunas mesas y sofás para los Vips. Pero ciñamonos a lo importante, tenemos grandes talentos y artistas, solo nos falta hablar de la difusión. Y de qué manera, Goya demuestra estar a la vanguardia de la tecnología con su sistema de sonido, Funktion One. Podemos asegurarte que si te dejas hipnotizar por los beats procedentes de sus torres y altavoces, nada volverá a parecerte lo mismo. En cuanto a la música, aquellos que se fijen únicamente en las grandes caras y figuras de la industria no verán más allá. Sin embargo, es algo que no suele importar a aquellos que aprecian realmente la indústria de la música dance. Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry. Si hablamos del dress code, nada está escrito, sin reglas, sin normas. Viste como quieras, como más a gusto de te sientas, como más cómodo bailes. ¿Qué más dará camisa o camiseta? Aquí lo importante es la música. Con Xceed puedes apuntarte a listas de descuento o comprar tu entrada anticipada. Normalmente podrás comprar entrada en taquilla, pero ten cuidado, el aforo es limitado y no queremos que te quedes en la puerta. Por ello te recomendamos que seas previsor y compres tu entrada anticipada mientras te ahorras un dinerito. En cuanto a horarios, a Goya no le gusta demasiado dormir. El club suele abrir sus puertas jueves, viernes y sábados. Tres veladas consecutivas donde manda la música de calidad.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta.

Aquella que realmente nos apasiona y nos hace mover los tobillos hasta bien entrada la madrugada. Haciendo honor a la calle en la que se encuentra ubicado el club, a escasos pasos de la parada de metro de Velázquez, encontramos Goya Social Club. Su aforo es limitado, no cuenta con una grandísima superficie ni espacio, pero no les hace falta. La idea de club que desde ya hace años manejan los chicos del Goya, es la de la intimidad y calidad. Siempre respaldadas por un exhaustivo trabajo por promover el talento local con algunas pinceladas internacionales. Un gran concepto que les ha hecho merecedores de un público afín y entregado a su oferta músical. Y es que bailar nos gusta, nos gusta mucho. La logística de los espacios del club es inmaculada, unos acabados interiores inspirados en los mejores clubs europeos donde manda el espacio central destinado a mover las caderas. Alrededor de él se articulan algunas mesas y sofás para los Vips. Pero ciñamonos a lo importante, tenemos grandes talentos y artistas, solo nos falta hablar de la difusión. Y de qué manera, Goya demuestra estar a la vanguardia de la tecnología con su sistema de sonido, Funktion One. Podemos asegurarte que si te dejas hipnotizar por los beats procedentes de sus torres y altavoces, nada volverá a parecerte lo mismo. En cuanto a la música, aquellos que se fijen únicamente en las grandes caras y figuras de la industria no verán más allá. Sin embargo, es algo que no suele importar a aquellos que aprecian realmente la indústria de la música dance. Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry. Si hablamos del dress code, nada está escrito, sin reglas, sin normas. Viste como quieras, como más a gusto de te sientas, como más cómodo bailes. ¿Qué más dará camisa o camiseta? Aquí lo importante es la música. Con Xceed puedes apuntarte a listas de descuento o comprar tu entrada anticipada. Normalmente podrás comprar entrada en taquilla, pero ten cuidado, el aforo es limitado y no queremos que te quedes en la puerta. Por ello te recomendamos que seas previsor y compres tu entrada anticipada mientras te ahorras un dinerito. En cuanto a horarios, a Goya no le gusta demasiado dormir. El club suele abrir sus puertas jueves, viernes y sábados. Tres veladas consecutivas donde manda la música de calidad.

Aquella que realmente nos apasiona y nos hace mover los tobillos hasta bien entrada la madrugada. Haciendo honor a la calle en la que se encuentra ubicado el club, a escasos pasos de la parada de metro de Velázquez, encontramos Goya Social Club. Su aforo es limitado, no cuenta con una grandísima superficie ni espacio, pero no les hace falta. La idea de club que desde ya hace años manejan los chicos del Goya, es la de la intimidad y calidad. Siempre respaldadas por un exhaustivo trabajo por promover el talento local con algunas pinceladas internacionales. Un gran concepto que les ha hecho merecedores de un público afín y entregado a su oferta músical. Y es que bailar nos gusta, nos gusta mucho. La logística de los espacios del club es inmaculada, unos acabados interiores inspirados en los mejores clubs europeos donde manda el espacio central destinado a mover las caderas. Alrededor de él se articulan algunas mesas y sofás para los Vips. Pero ciñamonos a lo importante, tenemos grandes talentos y artistas, solo nos falta hablar de la difusión. Y de qué manera, Goya demuestra estar a la vanguardia de la tecnología con su sistema de sonido, Funktion One. Podemos asegurarte que si te dejas hipnotizar por los beats procedentes de sus torres y altavoces, nada volverá a parecerte lo mismo. En cuanto a la música, aquellos que se fijen únicamente en las grandes caras y figuras de la industria no verán más allá. Sin embargo, es algo que no suele importar a aquellos que aprecian realmente la indústria de la música dance. Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry. Si hablamos del dress code, nada está escrito, sin reglas, sin normas. Viste como quieras, como más a gusto de te sientas, como más cómodo bailes. ¿Qué más dará camisa o camiseta? Aquí lo importante es la música. Con Xceed puedes apuntarte a listas de descuento o comprar tu entrada anticipada. Normalmente podrás comprar entrada en taquilla, pero ten cuidado, el aforo es limitado y no queremos que te quedes en la puerta. Por ello te recomendamos que seas previsor y compres tu entrada anticipada mientras te ahorras un dinerito. En cuanto a horarios, a Goya no le gusta demasiado dormir.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta. Sé atrevido, extravagante, cómico o convencional. Tu mismo ayudas a construir la experiencia que todos los asistentes van a vivir.

Aquella que realmente nos apasiona y nos hace mover los tobillos hasta bien entrada la madrugada. Haciendo honor a la calle en la que se encuentra ubicado el club, a escasos pasos de la parada de metro de Velázquez, encontramos Goya Social Club. Su aforo es limitado, no cuenta con una grandísima superficie ni espacio, pero no les hace falta. La idea de club que desde ya hace años manejan los chicos del Goya, es la de la intimidad y calidad. Siempre respaldadas por un exhaustivo trabajo por promover el talento local con algunas pinceladas internacionales. Un gran concepto que les ha hecho merecedores de un público afín y entregado a su oferta músical. Y es que bailar nos gusta, nos gusta mucho. La logística de los espacios del club es inmaculada, unos acabados interiores inspirados en los mejores clubs europeos donde manda el espacio central destinado a mover las caderas. Alrededor de él se articulan algunas mesas y sofás para los Vips. Pero ciñamonos a lo importante, tenemos grandes talentos y artistas, solo nos falta hablar de la difusión. Y de qué manera, Goya demuestra estar a la vanguardia de la tecnología con su sistema de sonido, Funktion One. Podemos asegurarte que si te dejas hipnotizar por los beats procedentes de sus torres y altavoces, nada volverá a parecerte lo mismo. En cuanto a la música, aquellos que se fijen únicamente en las grandes caras y figuras de la industria no verán más allá. Sin embargo, es algo que no suele importar a aquellos que aprecian realmente la indústria de la música dance. Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry. Si hablamos del dress code, nada está escrito, sin reglas, sin normas. Viste como quieras, como más a gusto de te sientas, como más cómodo bailes. ¿Qué más dará camisa o camiseta? Aquí lo importante es la música. Con Xceed puedes apuntarte a listas de descuento o comprar tu entrada anticipada. Normalmente podrás comprar entrada en taquilla, pero ten cuidado, el aforo es limitado y no queremos que te quedes en la puerta. Por ello te recomendamos que seas previsor y compres tu entrada anticipada mientras te ahorras un dinerito. En cuanto a horarios, a Goya no le gusta demasiado dormir. El club suele abrir sus puertas jueves, viernes y sábados. Tres veladas consecutivas donde manda la música de calidad.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta. Sé atrevido, extravagante, cómico o convencional. Tu mismo ayudas a construir la experiencia que todos los asistentes van a vivir.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta. Sé atrevido, extravagante, cómico o convencional. Tu mismo ayudas a construir la experiencia que todos los asistentes van a vivir. Mediante la app de Xceed puede acceder a listas de descuentos y reservar tus entradas anticipadas.

Aquella que realmente nos apasiona y nos hace mover los tobillos hasta bien entrada la madrugada. Haciendo honor a la calle en la que se encuentra ubicado el club, a escasos pasos de la parada de metro de Velázquez, encontramos Goya Social Club. Su aforo es limitado, no cuenta con una grandísima superficie ni espacio, pero no les hace falta. La idea de club que desde ya hace años manejan los chicos del Goya, es la de la intimidad y calidad. Siempre respaldadas por un exhaustivo trabajo por promover el talento local con algunas pinceladas internacionales. Un gran concepto que les ha hecho merecedores de un público afín y entregado a su oferta músical. Y es que bailar nos gusta, nos gusta mucho. La logística de los espacios del club es inmaculada, unos acabados interiores inspirados en los mejores clubs europeos donde manda el espacio central destinado a mover las caderas. Alrededor de él se articulan algunas mesas y sofás para los Vips. Pero ciñamonos a lo importante, tenemos grandes talentos y artistas, solo nos falta hablar de la difusión. Y de qué manera, Goya demuestra estar a la vanguardia de la tecnología con su sistema de sonido, Funktion One. Podemos asegurarte que si te dejas hipnotizar por los beats procedentes de sus torres y altavoces, nada volverá a parecerte lo mismo. En cuanto a la música, aquellos que se fijen únicamente en las grandes caras y figuras de la industria no verán más allá. Sin embargo, es algo que no suele importar a aquellos que aprecian realmente la indústria de la música dance. Ya sean derivados de la electrónica como House, Deep House, Tech-house y techno o la ferviente devoción que los sets con vinilos están volviendo a despertar entre las cabinas de los mejores clubs del mundo. Música disco, soul y funky que vuelve completamente locos a los amantes del género. Artistas locales como Hons, Oriol Calvo, Alffie y Decause convien con artistas más consolidados como Ion Pananides, Emanuel Satie, Camilo Franco, Nick Keller, Terrence Terry. Si hablamos del dress code, nada está escrito, sin reglas, sin normas. Viste como quieras, como más a gusto de te sientas, como más cómodo bailes. ¿Qué más dará camisa o camiseta? Aquí lo importante es la música. Con Xceed puedes apuntarte a listas de descuento o comprar tu entrada anticipada. Normalmente podrás comprar entrada en taquilla, pero ten cuidado, el aforo es limitado y no queremos que te quedes en la puerta. Por ello te recomendamos que seas previsor y compres tu entrada anticipada mientras te ahorras un dinerito. En cuanto a horarios, a Goya no le gusta demasiado dormir. El club suele abrir sus puertas jueves, viernes y sábados. Tres veladas consecutivas donde manda la música de calidad.

Dos salas que se organizan y gestionan con una idea común: diversidad y diversión. Los dos clubs comparten muro de carga por lo que las entradas de ambos están a escasos metros de distancia. Ambas atraen a un público moderno, alternativo y no convencional que, dependiendo del día, disfruta de los diversos ambientes, temáticas y géneros musicales que ofrecen los dos locales. Las reformas que se hicieron en las dos salas, después de que Pirandello I dejara de ser Low Club y Goldfield pasara a mejor vida para convertirse en Pirandello II, proporcionó una imagen totalmente rompedora que además cuenta con un sistema de sonido de última tecnología. El escenario perfecto para que ambas salas se decidieran incorporar nuevos sonidos y géneros musicales. Todos conocemos lo variada que es la oferta musical en Madrid. Si bien Pirandello I y II no ofrece una amplísima variedad de géneros ni vanguardia musical, no existe otro club en la capital con un ambiente como este. Da igual el día, da igual la fiesta, los chicos de Pirandello saben cómo hacer de la noche una experiencia única que no va a dejarte indiferente. La mejor música club, electro-pop, hip hop, latino, house y techno repartida en dos días y dos salas. Para ser más específicos: Los viernes en Pirandello I, la música electrónica es la protagonista: Un ambiente underground y alternativo donde dependiendo del artista invitado vivirás sesiones mágicas del house a la más vieja escuela, el techno más purista o el tech house más rompedor. Los viernes en Pirandello II son sinónimo de CUENCA, la fiesta que ha roto con los paradigmas preestablecidos de la noche en la capital. Sonarán todos los temazos comerciales actuales, indie pop, rock y electrónica. Los sábados por la noche, tanto en Pirandello I como en Pirandello II, es la cita de Hysterical Pop, todas las salas y espacios de Pirandello se unen para acoger la fiesta gay-friendly referencia de la capital. Un conjunto de tres salas donde sonará pop nacional, pop internacional y latino respectivamente. La fiesta gay de moda que lleva tantos años arrasando en Madrid ahora en manos de Pirandello. No es que haya una política marcada relativa en cuanto al dress code, sino que desde Pirandello animan a que con tu outfit des tu toque personal a la fiesta. Sé atrevido, extravagante, cómico o convencional. Tu mismo ayudas a construir la experiencia que todos los asistentes van a vivir.
